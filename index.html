				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is now the 4th quarter of SY 2020-2021, nearing the end of the school year. For us, students it is an exciting part of the school year as the long anticipated school break is coming, we are free from the requirements from school, we can do whatever we want from playing games, sleep all day, exercise, hobbies, anything. Though, reflecting back on online classes is a good thing. It reminds me that I could endure such hard times of school.

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSecond thing that I can say about online classes is that, is Philippines really ready for this? I can see in social media that students are doing business or dropped out of their schools, with a common reason, they dont have enough funds to buy materials or gadgets needed for online classes. I am fortunate enough and blessed enough that my parents are still working and provide for my needs, I am truly grateful for them. Everytime I see those students who just dropped out or have a job that they need to support their education that burdens them a lot more, I began to really question that, is Philippines ready for online classes?

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLastly, given that some students are fortunate enough that they can handle online classes, do they have motivation to do so? Lately, a lot of students are having a grade of NG. Which startled and scared me a lot. It made me realize that some students are not mentally prepared for online classes, thus, they cannot do assignments. Furthermore, students lack social interaction, which is a big part of their lives and personal development. I think that this contributes to the lack of motivation students are having. <br>
				I really think that there should be changes that can be made. Which is in the next article (article 2).
